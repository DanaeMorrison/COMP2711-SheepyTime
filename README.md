#Sheepy Time

This repository contains the first project I worked on utilizing GitHub for collaboration with a team. We developed a digital version of a board game called Sheepy Time in Java.

In this class, we delved deeply into object-oriented programming and implemented various design patterns such as the factory, builder, and decorator patterns to make our code clean and reusable.

We also learned about the MVC architecture (Model, View, Controller) for separating our code into components with predefined relationships on how they should communicate.

These helped us to make our code open to extension but closed to modification- a principle of object-oriented programming. We developed tests for unit and integration testing and documented the code so we and others could understand the purpose of the various classes and functions in the code.
