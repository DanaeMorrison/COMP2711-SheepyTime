#Sheepy Time

This repository contains the first project I worked on making use of GitHub for collaboration with a team. We developed a digital version of a board game called Sheepy Time.

In this class we delved deeply into the world of object-oriented programming and immplemented various design patterns such as the factory, builder, and decorator patterns to make our code clean and reusable.

We also learned about the MVC architecture (Model, View, Controller) to separate our code into components with predefined relationships on how they should communicate.

These helped us to make our code open to extension but closed to modification- a principle of object oriented programming.
